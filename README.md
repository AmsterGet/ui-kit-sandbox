To see a published showcase of the latest components released, follow the [link]() (to be provided).

### Code style

### CSS

#### Theming

We use [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) to provide colour/font/etc values for different themes via theme-specific CSS classes.
All components get the appropriate theme values at runtime based on the cascading nature of CSS.

We chose this approach because it is easy to use and maintain, and CSS Custom Properties are part of [WEB standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/) and supported by [all major browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*#browser_compatibility).
